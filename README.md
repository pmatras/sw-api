## Run project

To run the project using Docker compose stack, just run (env file has been already filled to save time)

```sh
pnpm start:docker:dev
```

## Swagger UI

To access the Swagger UI, visit `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`

## Notes

- pnpm is being used as package manager of choice
- tests are only added for Episode module to save some time on development and only for single methods to rather showcase the overall approach than thoroughly test this simple app
  and all of its components in the same style
